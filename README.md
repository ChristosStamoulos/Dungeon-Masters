# Dungeon Masters

## Overview
This repository contains the Unity project for the "Dungeon Masters" dungeon crawler game, developed as part of the Computer Graphics final assignment for the academic year 2024-25. The game is an interactive 3D dungeon crawler where the player guides a hero through a maze-like environment to collect treasures while avoiding deadly traps.

## Features
- **Dungeon Design**: The game map features a dungeon that is designed with interconnected rooms and corridors.  
- **Traps**: Every room except the central one contains traps consisting a "dangerous" for collecting  trophies 
- **Treasure Collection**: The player has to collect all the trophies to win the game.
-  **Lighting and Effects**:  Appropriate light sources and effects are used to create an immersive environment.
- **Interactive Elements** Treasures and traps interact with the player using collision detection and life management.
- **Multilevel Dungeon**: After the player collects all the trophies of the first floor there is an elevator that guides him to the room of the last trophy underground.

## Game Play
- **Player  Controls**:  This game integrates the new abstracted input system of Unity but no controller support is implemented the player moves using the (WSAD) keyboard keys.

- **Camera System**:  In order to create a smooth game play experience Dungeon Masters uses the cinemachine system of Unity. The camera follows the player's movement and rotation, while the user can zoom in and out and rotate the camera using the mouse.
